Doggie Gallery Commercial License (DGCL)
=======================================

Version 1.0 — 2025-02-15

This license governs use of the Doggie Gallery source code and associated
assets (the “Product”). By copying, installing, or using the Product, you
agree to the terms below.

1. Definitions
--------------
- **Author** refers to the original developer and copyright holder of the
  Product.
- **Licensee** refers to the individual or business entity that purchases or
  otherwise obtains a valid copy of the Product from the Author or an
  authorised marketplace (including CodeCanyon).
- **End Product** means one (1) finished application, website, or other
  software solution that incorporates the Product or derivative works of the
  Product for distribution to an end user.
- **Client** means a third party for whom the Licensee is developing an End
  Product.

2. Grant of License
-------------------
Subject to payment of all applicable fees, the Author grants the Licensee a
perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:

1. Use and modify the Product source code to create **one (1) End Product** for
   personal use or for one Client.
2. Distribute, sell, or otherwise make that End Product available to end users
   in binary or compiled form only.

Each additional End Product requires the purchase of a separate license.

3. Permitted Use
----------------
- The Licensee may modify, refactor, and extend the Product to suit the needs
  of the End Product.
- The Licensee may host the Product’s source code in private version-control
  systems for the purpose of collaboration with authorised team members.
- The Licensee may advertise or promote the End Product provided attribution to
  the Author is not misrepresented.

4. Restrictions
---------------
The Licensee **must not**:

1. Redistribute, resell, sublicense, or share the Product (original or
   modified) in source code form, whether for free or for a fee, outside of the
   End Product.
2. Include the Product in any open-source repository or public code archive
   except where access is restricted to authorised collaborators under
   equivalent confidentiality obligations.
3. Use the Product to generate an End Product whose primary value is direct
   access to the Product itself (e.g., starter kits, code templates, or
   resellable themes).
4. Remove or alter any copyright or proprietary notices included by the Author
   in the Product, except where necessary to make modifications for the End
   Product while retaining equivalent attribution in documentation or about
   pages.

5. Third-Party Components
-------------------------
The Product bundles or references third-party libraries (e.g., AndroidX,
Retrofit, Glide, Google Mobile Ads, Firebase, and others) that are each subject
to their own licenses. Those licenses continue to govern your use of the
respective components. It is the Licensee’s responsibility to review and comply
with all third-party terms.

6. Ownership
------------
The Product remains the intellectual property of the Author. Except for the
limited rights expressly granted in this license, no other rights or ownership
are transferred to the Licensee.

7. Warranty & Liability
-----------------------
The Product is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, express or
implied. The Author is not liable for any damages (including incidental or
consequential damages, loss of profits, or business interruption) arising out of
the use or inability to use the Product or derived End Product.

8. Termination
--------------
This license terminates automatically if the Licensee breaches any of its terms
and fails to cure the breach within 15 days of receiving written notice. Upon
termination, the Licensee must cease distribution of the End Product and delete
all copies of the Product, except as required to support existing end users of
previously shipped End Products.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------
This license is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Author is
domiciled, unless otherwise required by applicable consumer protections. If any
provision of this license is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain
in effect.
